 Abstract classes are classes that cannot be initialized (You cannot call its constructor directly )
 They can contain code or they may just bbe skeleton classes

// ! extends - inherit from particular class (max 1)
// ! with - The with keyword allow you to mix a "mixin" with your class. [inherit more than 1 class]
// ! Abstract class can have a constructor
// ! Abstract class without constructor can act as mixins
// ! Abstract class with constructor cannot be a mixin

 Mixins are abstract classes that not have constructor
 // constraints on mixins
